Aegean - Fast, scalable graph processing

What is this?
A graph processing library under active development. More details will come soon.

Languages?
We plan to use C++, although we are open to suggestions.

Timeline?
That will depend on my availability. They say existential dread is a good motivator for productivity, hopefully this project will be an example of that. Below are a list of items I like to implement in the near futureTM.

1. The underlying graph object.
2. The support for templated token objects as references to nodes.
3. Basic APIs for accessing and processing the graph objects
4. Useful common algorithms, BFS, DFS, Minimum Spanning Trees and SSSP, etc.
5. More extensive documentation on the code base and APIs.
6. Other useful graph algorithms. Suggestions welcome.
